My code is made up of 3 different files, index.html, Contact.html, and Portfolio.html. In the index.html file that's where the about me and two videos are located. The top of each of the pages has a navigation bar at the top to switch through pages. The header is h1 and labeled Belal Al-Dhaibani. the subheading is h2 and is labeled About and the description of the about is a table that contains an image in the second row and the image has an alt text. On the bottom I added a youtube video and a video file which are both centered in the middle of the page but with different sizes. My Portfolio page has a table in the body with education header in the first row and job experience in the second row and they're both in the first column. The next column has the information of the education and job experience. Under both of these I created an ordered list in a table with three images in the first colum and first row which spans 4 rows down. The contact page has a unordered list t the top with an email embeded with an external link that lets them send me an email and the second element in the list is the phone number. Under the list is a picture that is embedded with the dal link. Reused code from assignment 1. My code is made up of three webpages, Index, Portfolio and Contact. The navigation bar is an unordered list and I created the navigation bar to be a flex box. The Index is an about me that is made up of grids with use of flexs to stack the elements on top of each other. It's split into 2 grid boxes with the about me information on the left and the two videos in one other gridbox but uses flex to stack the images on top of each other. The portfolio webpage has the education and job experience structured using flex boxes so that they are side by side, and the projects are structured using grid boxes. The grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; creates a 3 column grid with one row. The contact webpage has the email and phonenumber in an ordered list, aswell as an image. The ordered list has a background color and the email and phonenumber text have been spaced out using padding. The image is also spaced out from the text using the margin property. All links have the hover feature and change color whenever a cursor is hovering over them.
